# Catching The Fraudsters!!!

# Project Overview

Our project will be to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a claim application is fraudulent or not. Insurance fraud occurs when "someone puts false information on an insurance application and when false or misleading information is given or important information is omitted in an insurance transaction or claim" (Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions, 2019).
This can be useful to insurance companies in avoiding costs they normally do not have to incur. 

# Data Source
Data was sourced from www.kaggle.com and was updated a year ago. This data shows many features, the chosen target variable of “FraudFound_P”.
